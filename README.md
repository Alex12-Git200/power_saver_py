This is a python script that works with linux laptops, that have and use power porfiles daemon. Without it this script is useless. Basically, what this script does is check if plugged, check some percentages and adjust the power profile. In the future, i will probably make it more smart, like make it check for fan speed, temps and all that, now the programm is pretty easy, just 40 lines of code.
